				<dc:description>This is one of two interviews that took place at the Atlanta residence of Charlee Lambert.

She has served as an expert witness in elder abuse cases and served as a consultant on elder abuse.

				<dc:description>Interviewed at Georgia State University by Morna Gerrard, Mary Finn describes her life from childhood to the present, detailing the direction her college interests took in developing a career path in criminal justice and psychology. She discusses her early work with prisoners: analysis of motive for criminal behavior, gender differences and their mental health. She also discusses domestic violence as a subject for awareness and the need for redressing legal protection. This interview is part one of two.</dc:description>
				<dc:description>Mary A. Finn is Director and Professor in the School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State University. Her research addresses problems and issues directly related to justice policy and practice. She has collaborated extensively with local justice agencies, advocacy organizations, and divisions of the state government in efforts to bridge the world of academia and the world of policy and practice. Dr. Finn’s research has been funded by the National Institute of Justice and the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles and Department of Corrections. She is currently a co-principal investigator on a National Institute of Justice project assessing the influence of home visits and their temporal ordering on the supervision outcomes with high-risk parolees. Her most recent publications appear in Criminology &amp; Public Policy, Crime &amp; Delinquency, and the Journal of Interpersonal Violence. Prior to joining MSU, Dr. Finn served as the Associate Provost for Institutional Effectiveness and Acting Director of Institutional Research at Georgia State University and participated in the Harvard University program on Performance Assessment in Higher Education and the Bryn Mawr College Summer Institute for Women in Higher Education Administration.</dc:description>

				<dc:description>Roger Rochat discusses his life's work involving maternal mortality, abortion, family planning and reproductive health. The interview touches upon his time at CDC, USAID and his research in demography abroad as well as in the United States.</dc:description>
				<dc:description>Dr. Roger Rochat completed his residency at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. He joined CDCâ€™s Epidemic Intelligence Service and was assigned to the Family Planning Evaluation Activity and the Georgia Health Department. One of his first tasks was to determine whether the new Georgia state law legalizing abortion would reduce maternal mortality. Because of restrictive access to services, it would not. A lawyer cited this social inequity inÂ Doe v. Bolton, the Supreme Court case from Georgia that was decided concurrently withÂ Roe v. Wade. In 1981, Dr. Rochat became the first Director of the Division of Reproductive Health for the CDC. In 1985, he developed the Global Health Track in Community Health at Emory, then worked 2 years for USAID in India, and then spent six years developing Maternal and Child Health epidemiology in the Georgia Health Department. After 30 years with CDC, working in 30+ countries and with many State Health Departments, he retired from CDC in 1999, went with his brother briefly to Antarctica, and then joined the Rollins School of Public Health where he has appointments in Departments of Global Health and Epidemiology and in Emory Medical schoolâ€™s Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics. He serves as Director of Graduate Studies, Hubert Department of Global Health and co-teaches four public health courses related to reproductive health, including The GEMMA Seminar: The Global Elimination of Maternal Mortality from Abortion. Â Roger and Susan RochatÂ have endowed the GEMMA fund to support Emory MPH students conducting international research aimed at eliminating maternal deaths from abortion.</dc:description>

				<dc:description>Martha Aenchbacher is interviewed in her home by Samantha Harvill. Aenchbacher discusses her childhood experiences and socialization that helped to mold her sense of ethics. She also discusses her adult life and education, which influenced the activism she involved herself in, working with adult mental health clinics and in the first rape crisis center and first hospice in Georgia.</dc:description>
				<dc:description>Martha Aenchbacher was born in Russell County, Kentucky. When she was a child, her family moved to south Georgia, where witnessing poverty and racial injustice inspired the development of her social conscience. Aenchbacher enrolled in Georgia Southwestern College at age 16. While in college, she met her husband, Louie, with whom she had seven children. Aenchbacher finished her college education in Savannah, Ga., where she majored in social work and became interested in feminism and the women's movement. She became active in a local chapter of the National Organization for Women. She and some of her social work colleagues worked to establish the first rape crisis center in Georgia in order to address the problem of inadequate care that was often provided to rape victims. She also worked with what would become the first hospice in Georgia. Aenchbacher later earned a master's degree in psychology and worked as a counselor.</dc:description>

				<dc:description>Sandra Barnhill begins by discussing her family, including their strong sense of spirituality and experiences living overseas because of her father's position in the military. She discusses her undergraduate education at Agnes Scott College and Georgia State University, and attending law school at the University of Texas. While in law school, Barnhill began working at a legal assistance clinic, where she provided legal resources to inmates. As a result of this work and some of her law school coursework, Barnhill became interested in providing access to legal services for disenfranchised people. After law school, she began practicing law involving death penalty cases. Barnhill discusses the racism and sexism she experienced in a profession dominated by white men. During her time working on death penalty and prison condition cases, Barnhill became interested in the specific needs of women prisoners, and she eventually founded the organization that became Foreverfamily, an Atlanta-based nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting children of incarcerated parents.</dc:description>
				<dc:description>Sandra Barnhill earned her BA in political science at Georgia State University (1982), and her J.D. at the University of Texas (1984). From 1983 to 1987, she served as a staff attorney for the Southern Prisoners' Defense Committee. In this role, she represented indigent prisoners in class action challenges to prison conditions and in post-conviction challenges on capital convictions. During this time, Barnhill became frustrated by the lack of support given to mothers sentenced to prison, and their families. In 1987, she founded Foreverfamily (originally named Aid to Imprisoned Mothers (AIM)), which is a nonprofit Atlanta-based organization advocating for inmate parents and their children. In 2004, the Ford Foundation recognized Barnhill for her outstanding leadership efforts.</dc:description>

				<dc:contributor>Riddle, Mary, 1949-</dc:contributor>
				<dc:description>Hesse begins the interview by discussing the impact of Marsha Cofield's lawsuit, for which Hesse and other DeKalb County police officers fundraised. She discusses the difficulty that she had getting promoted because of her gender, and she goes into detail about various instances of being undermined and challenged by her superiors on the job. Hesse discusses several areas of police work in depth, including the mobile crisis unit and her management of it, and police responses to domestic violence calls. She talks about the murder of DeKalb County sheriff-elect Derwin Brown, and discusses the deleterious effects that working as a police officer often has on a person's mental health. Hesse describes the artistic pursuits in which she has engaged since leaving the police force, including dance and writing.</dc:description>
				<dc:description>Lynn Hesse is a former policewoman of DeKalb County, Georgia, as well as a playwright, dancer, and short story author. Born in 1951 in Chanute, Kansas, she moved with her parents to the Buckhead area of Atlanta when she was a pre-teenager. After reading The Feminist Mystique by Betty Friedan at the approximate age of 15, she self-identified as a feminist. Hesse graduated through Clayton County Academy and went to work for Georgia State University as a police officer (post-certified) in circa 1977, and subsequently became a DeKalb County police officer, rising through the ranks of Master Officer and Field Training Officer to Sergeant. During her tenure as a DeKalb County Police Officer, she was denied her application for promotional testing and her compensation for arrests was diverted to other male officers. She and several other female officers were equally discriminated against. When a class action suit could not be organized, policewoman Marsha Cofield filed an individual law suit, in which Lynne Hesse was actively involved. Cofield won her case. Following her law enforcement career, Hesse has focused on her artistic pursuits which include dance and writing. In 1996, she was graduated (cum laude) in Dance from Georgia State University. She has created an "oral history performed in dance," and play she wrote, based on her own short story, was staged at Emory's Schwartz Center.</dc:description>

				<dc:description>In this interview, Carolyn Curry begins by discussing her family background, particularly her mother and grandmother, who were independent, opinionated women. She describes her own education--she attended Agnes Scott College for two years, then left when her husband, Bill, was drafted to play for the Green Bay Packers and she moved with him to Wisconsin. She resumed her studies at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin and eventually returned to finish her undergraduate degree at Agnes Scott. Over the next several years, Curry gave birth to two children and Bill was traded to the Baltimore Colts; the Curry family divided their time between Baltimore and Atlanta. Curry earned a master's degree and a Ph.D. in history at Georgia State University. Curry discusses her dissertation, a biography of Civil War diarist and feminist Ella Gertrude Clanton Thomas. She also talks about the role of feminism in her life and the lives of the women she has known, including discussions of the Equal Rights Amendment, gender dynamics in marriages, and trends she has witnessed in academia. Curry talks at length about her husband's career in football playing, coaching, and broadcasting, including the effect that moving frequently had on her and her children. She talks about her work teaching history in various locales, and about how seeing a close friend's husband die suddenly inspired her to found the nonprofit organization Women Alone Together, which supports women who are alone because of the death of a spouse, divorce, single by choice, or alone in a marriage because of separation or estrangement.</dc:description>
				<dc:description>Born in Mobile, Ala., in 1942, Carolyn Curry earned a B.A. in English from Agnes Scott College (1966), and an M.A. and Ph.D. in history at Georgia State University (1979; 1987). She has taught at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky and the Westminster Schools in Atlanta, Georgia. Compelled by women's stories shared with her during years of research and teaching, Curry founded Women Alone Together in Atlanta in 2002. Curry is the Founder and Director of Women Alone Together, a 501(c)(3) non-profit foundation that addresses the special needs of women who are alone because of the death of a spouse, divorce, single by choice, or alone in a marriage because of separation or estrangement. In addition to writing papers on significant women's issues, she often speaks to various groups around the country on those issues and about Women Alone Together. Curry is the author of Suffer and Grow Strong: The Life of Ella Gertrude Clanton Thomas 1834-1907 (Mercer University Press, Macon Georgia 2014). For more than 50 years, she has been married to Bill Curry, the former head football coach at Georgia Tech, the University of Alabama, the University of Kentucky, and Georgia State University.</dc:description>

				<dc:description>Naunie Batchelder discusses her family history, childhood, and college years. She details her years as an Air Force wife, moving to many different cities with her husband Joshua Batchelder. Naunie discusses her work as a psychic, including the way that the public's perceptions of psychics have changed over the years--according to her, the work has become much less stigmatized since she began. Naunie and interviewer Franklin Abbott discuss their mutual friend, the late Raven Wolfdancer, whom Naunie helped train as a psychic. Naunie shares about her spiritual beliefs and gives advice about staying positive in the face of adversity.</dc:description>
				<dc:description>Naunie Batchelder grew up in Elberton, Ga. As a child, she experienced serious illness and nearly lost the ability to walk. Batchelder attended Valdosta State University, where she met her first husband Joshua Batchelder, who worked on a nearby Air Force base. Joshua became an Air Force officer, and he and Naunie moved several times, including to Goose Bay (Labrador), Boston, New York, and Seattle before moving to Atlanta. They later divorced, and Naunie married her second husband Lee Harris, whom she also divorced. In college, Naunie discovered that she had psychic abilities, and she honed them in college and in New York. In Atlanta, Naunie began giving psychic readings at an informal New Age group, than at the Foundation of Truth. She later left the organization but continued to support herself doing psychic readings.</dc:description>

				<dc:description>In this interview, Rachel May provides an overview of her life and work. She describes her childhood in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., which she describes as an idyllic, if homogeneous, place to grow up. She discusses her grandparents, including her maternal grandfather, who survived Bergen-Belsen concentration camp during World War II. May describes her mother as "quirky" and "bohemian" and details how, as an adult, she has come to appreciate her mother's unconventional tendencies. May talks about how her experiences traveling abroad in college helped her develop a sense of confidence. She briefly discusses an on-again, off-again relationship she had that resulted in her moving to Atlanta, where she met her husband Daniel May. She talks about the process of co-founding Synchronicity Theatre with three colleagues, and the evolution of Synchronicity from an itinerant theater company to an independent theater. May discusses the desire to give back to the community that led her to engage with various community groups through Synchronicity, and she talks about several specific community projects that Synchronicity has participated in. She discusses her children's burgeoning interest in theater, as well as the challenges of parenting while sustaining an intense and demanding career.</dc:description>
				<dc:description>One of Synchronicity Theater's original founders, Rachel May has directed more than 15 productions for it, including In the Next Room or the Vibrator Play, Exit Pursued by a Bear, Women + War, 1:23, Language of Angels, Three Sisters and Marisol. Her directing work has been seen in and around Atlanta at Actor’s Express, Aurora Theatre, Theatre Gael, Dad’s Garage and the University of Georgia. Creative Loafing named her best director of 2002 for her work on One Flea Spare and Kia Corthron’s Breath, Boom, the production that led to the creation of our Playmaking for Girls program. In June 2004 she was chosen for the highly competitive NEA/TCG Career Development Program for Directors and was named a Bank of America “Local Hero.” In addition to her executive role at Synchronicity, she actively teaches and leads workshops across Atlanta, and spent eight summers as director of the Ferst Center’s Drama Camp at Georgia Tech.</dc:description>

				<dc:description>Therapist and family counselor June Dobbs Butts was born on June 11, 1928 in Atlanta, Georgia. She is the youngest daughter of Irene and John Wesley Dobbs, one of Atlantaâ€™s most prominent African American leaders before the Civil Rights Movement. Butts is also the aunt of the late Honorable Maynard Jackson, Atlantaâ€™s first black mayor. Butts received her B.A. degree in sociology from Spelman College in 1948, setting a national education record â€“ six sisters graduating from the same college. That same summer, Butts worked with her close friend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Then, in the fall of 1948, she entered the Teacherâ€™s College of Columbia University in New York City, where she received her Ed.D. degree in family life education. Buttsâ€™ professional career began in 1950 as a professor in the psychology department at Fisk University. She went on to work at Tennessee State University, Howard University College of Medicine and Meharry Medical College, where she was also a researcher. While serving on the Board of Directors of Planned Parenthood in the 1970s, Butts met famed sex researchers Masters and Johnson, who invited her to join their staff at the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation (later called Masters and Johnson Institute) in St. Louis, Missouri. There, Butts became the first African American to be trained as a sex therapist by Masters and Johnson. She later served as a visiting scientist at the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. Butts resides in Atlanta. She is the mother of three children (one deceased), and one granddaughter (Biographical note adapted from The History Makers website).</dc:description>
